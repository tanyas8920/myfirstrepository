Hi, I am Tanya Singh, a freshman in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. Some of my best coding languages include Java, R, and a little bit of Python. Other than that, I am well versed in IDEs such as Eclipse, JGrasp, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, collaboration, teamwork, and communication are some of my soft skills which really help me thrive when working with others. In the past, I have worked two jobs, one where I was a code sensei at Code Ninjas, and one where I was a math Tutor at Sylvan learning center. Aside from this, I have done a lot of projects throughout my time at UMD, all of which involved an extensive knowledge of Java. I am happy to share my past projects with potential employers, though I am unable to post it online due to University of Maryland regulations.
